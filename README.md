# Data-Analysis-of-Historical-product-data
# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing historical product demand data to identify key trends, patterns, and forecast future demand. The analysis will help improve inventory management, optimize supply chain operations, and guide strategic business decisions.

The dataset includes product codes, warehouses, product categories, dates, and order demand values. It will undergo cleaning, preprocessing, descriptive analysis, time series decomposition, and demand forecasting to deliver actionable insights.

# Project Objectives

1.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Standardize data formats (e.g., date conversion).

Handle missing data and errors (e.g., negative demand values).

2.Descriptive Statistics:

Analyze the overall demand distribution by product, warehouse, and category.

Summarize statistical findings and key observations.

3.Time Series Analysis:

Identify trends and seasonality in demand using time series decomposition.

Explore cyclic patterns and potential influencing factors.

4.Demand Forecasting:

Use ARIMA or similar models to predict future demand.

Validate and improve the forecasting model for accuracy.

5.Visualization:

Create visual representations of the data, trends, and forecasts for better interpretation.

Highlight important findings with clear charts and graphs.

6.Report Generation:

Compile the findings, methodologies, and results into a final report.

Provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis and forecasting.

# Project Structure

# Main Tasks:

Analyze Head, Tail, Description, and Information of the data.

Convert Date column to datetime format.

Handle missing values in the Date column.

Verify and correct data types for all columns.

Remove or address negative values in Order_Demand.

Review the cleaned dataset for consistency and accuracy.

Perform descriptive analysis on demand distribution across products, warehouses, and categories.

Aggregate Order_Demand by Date to create a daily demand series.

Decompose time series to identify trends, seasonality, and residuals.

Forecast future demand using models such as ARIMA.

Visualize the demand distribution and key insights.

Compile all findings into a comprehensive final report.

# Subtasks:
Each main task has detailed subtasks, which include steps like handling errors, generating visualizations, and validating data. These subtasks can be assigned to team members in ASANA to manage workload effectively.

# Data:

The project starts with the provided dataset, which includes:

Product_Code: Unique identifier for each product.

Warehouse: Location where the product is stored.

Product_Category: Product category classification.

Date: Date of the demand record.

Order_Demand: Quantity of product demand recorded on the specified date.

# Steps:

Start with Data Cleaning and Preprocessing to prepare the dataset for analysis.

Conduct Descriptive Analysis to get insights on overall demand distribution.

Perform Time Series Analysis to identify trends and seasonality.

Build and validate the Forecasting Model.

Generate Visualizations for clear communication of results.

Compile all findings into the Final Report.

# Tools & Technologies

Python: Used for data manipulation, analysis, and forecasting (pandas etc.).

ASANA: For project management and tracking tasks/subtasks.

# Expected Outcomes

Improved understanding of product demand patterns.

Accurate demand forecasting to support inventory and supply chain management.

Data-driven insights that contribute to better decision-making for business strategy.
